# 1999-original
The original version I wrote while learning JavaScript back in 1999. You can see it live at http://varnaman.com/tetris-js/

My goal was to write as little HTML as possible and do everything in JavaScript, including building of the HTML layout itself. The script dynamically creates HTML elements by directly manipulating the DOM. Coding style is heavily inspired by C/C++ which was my primary coding language at the time.
