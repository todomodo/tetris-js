# 1999-original
The 1999 version I wrote while learning JavaScript back in 1999. You can see it live at http://varnaman.com/tetris-js/

The goal was to write as little HTML as possible and do everything in JavaScript, including building of the HTML layout itself. The script dynamically creates HTML elements by directly manipulating the DOM. Coding style is heavily inspired by C/C++ which were my primary coding languages at the time.
