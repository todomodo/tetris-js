# 2019-react
Starting 2017, I began encountering React at my job. Implementing the old tetris project in React is a good way to learn how it does things.

## Setup
After cloning the repo, build the docker container:
```
./bin/do_build
```

Then start it:
```
./bin/do_run_server
```

... and finally, navigate to http://localhost:3000/
